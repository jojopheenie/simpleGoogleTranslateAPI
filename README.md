Getting started:

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
2.  Run npm install.
3.  Start the build process and your application with: npm run start-dev. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute npm run start-server and npm run build-watch separately (in their own terminal tabs).
4.  Enter localhost:8080 in your URL bar.
